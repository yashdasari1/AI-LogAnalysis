## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Deep Log Understanding**: Uses a BERT-based model for advanced natural language understanding of logs.
- 🗂️ **Error Classification**: Automatically classifies logs into meaningful error types.
- 🔁 **Self-Learning Engine**: Continuously retrains itself with past logs to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving systems.
- ⚙️ **Flexible Integration**: Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or monitoring systems for real-time insights.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Ingests raw error logs.
2. Applies a BERT-based NLP model to interpret the content.
3. Classifies each log into a predefined or learned category.
4. Stores and uses

## 🔄 Continual Learning

Every time new logs are processed, they contribute to strengthening the model:
- Detects drifts in log patterns.
- Improves accuracy with domain-specific data over time.
- Builds resilience and adaptability over long-term usage.
